Born into a typically large mid-western family, Nathaniel was the younger of two siblings but in the middle of the cousins age range. His grandparents had a working farm that he would spend much time at helping with whatever chores needed doing. He was smart and exceled at school. During his Senior year he did an exchange program to Germany. Seeing the land of his ancestors opened him up to a different culture though there were glimpses of it back home. This first adventure opened him up to 
more. He decided to move to Hawaii for a Political Science Bactorlors because of the diverse cultures of the people living there. While in college more life changing adventures happened. He was able to go to China with the Chore and he met his future wife, Melissa.
Nathaniel and Melissa waited until they had both graduated from college to tie the knot and did so back in the mid-west as more than half the family was there but returned to Hawaii after. Nathaniel continued his travels and they went to Japan for their honey moon. They loved it so much they returned several times in the coming years often staying 3 to 4 weeks at a time visiting different places within the country. He also returned to school and was able to complete a Master's program.
Tragedy struck a few years after the pandemic, Nathaniel had a serious medical condition that left him unable to do many things he once loved. Currently he is working hard to overcome these difficulties and be able travel and his hobbies more fully again</figcaption>
