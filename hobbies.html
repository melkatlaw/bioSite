			    <figcaption>Starting from an early age, his father got him into gaming, and they would often play together. He started with the Super Nintendo, playing mostly games in the Mario franchise. Through the years, consoles changed and he was able to receive them as gifts here and there. Once he was old enough, he would get the newest consoles and, if he liked the title, games. Currently, he is waiting for the next Elder Scrolls game like so many fans of the franchise.</figcaption>

			    <figcaption>Whether it be visiting museums or singing in a choir, art and the cultures it represents are a great pastime. Due to traveling so much, a love of art grew with it. More realistic paintings and interesting statues are what most draw his attention, as well as Asian influenced pieces. He has also taken a crack at painting with oil paints in the Bob Ross style and enjoys watching Bob Ross' show as well.</figcaption>

			    <figcaption>He started as a lake diver in the mid-west, moved to Hawaii and dove a few times, though finances make snorkeling more accessible. He has a favorite spot on the North shore, Sharks Cove. However, it's only accessible around the summer months. As the seasons change, the swells on North Shore grow to extreme sizes making snorkeling and diving unsafe. However, during the winter time, it is fun to watch the expert surfers ride the monster waves.</figcaption>
