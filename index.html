<p>Born into a typically large mid-western family, Nathaniel was the younger of two siblings but in the middle of the cousins' age range. His grandparents had a working farm where he spent much time helping with whatever chores needed doing. He was smart and excelled at school. During his senior year, he participated in an exchange program to Germany. Seeing the land of his ancestors opened him up to a different culture, though there were glimpses of it back home.</p>
<p>This first adventure opened him up to more. He decided to move to Hawaii to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Political Science because of the diverse cultures of the people living there. While in college, more life-changing adventures happened. He was able to go to China with the Choir and he met his future wife.</p>
<p>Nathaniel and his wife waited until they had both graduated from college to tie the knot. They did so back in the mid-west as more than half of the soon-to-be united family was there, but returned to Hawaii afterward. Nathaniel continued his travels and they went to Japan for their honeymoon. They loved it so much they returned several times in the coming years, often staying 3 to 4 weeks at a time visiting different places within the country. He also returned to school and was able to complete a Master's program.</p>
<p>Tragedy struck a few years after the pandemic. Nathaniel had a serious medical condition that left him unable to do many things he once loved. Currently, he is working hard to overcome these difficulties and be able to travel and do his hobbies more fully once again.</p>
